# Structure-based Drug Discovery

```
Structure-Based Drug Discovery (SBDD) is a powerful, rational approach to designing new medicines that leverages detailed 3D structural knowledge of the biological target (usually a protein) and its interaction with potential drug molecules. It's a cornerstone of modern pharmaceutical research.
